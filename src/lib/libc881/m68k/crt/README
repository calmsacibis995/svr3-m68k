/*	@(#)README	6.1		*/

	The following are some general observations which may provide
enlightenment as to certain idiosyncracies found in this directory's
source:

	1.  These assembly language routines do not all provide the
	    same level of error checking.  This is because the original
	    routines in "libc/m68k/crt" ALSO did not provide the same
	    level of error checking.  For example, compare "dbtol.s" and
	    "ftol.s", which you would expect to be similar.  However, the
	    original "dbtol" handles NaNs, while the original "ftol"
	    does not.  Thus, "dbtol" is a longer routine than "ftol".
