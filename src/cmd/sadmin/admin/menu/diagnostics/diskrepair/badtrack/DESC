#menu#  BAD TRACK HANDLING

#help#
#help#	The commands in this menu provide functions for redirecting one or
#help#	more bad tracks on a disk, for checking the file system after a track
#help#  redirection and for clearing fsck input files from /etc/badtracks.
#help#  You will be asked for details about the disk you are using such as
#help#	the size, the maker, and the device name.  It is strongly 
#help#	recommended that you run the fixfsys option after the reformat so
#help#  any file system damage can be repaired.  At that time, you, the 
#help#  administrator, will be notified which files have been corrupted and
#help#	should be restored from backup tapes.
