Files that the backup and restore systems needs, other than the average
UNIX utilities...

/bin/sh		modified Bourne shell  (GG)
bru		the modified 6.6  bru or later  (GG)
at		and directories in /usr/lib/cron & /usr/spool/cron
cron		and associated directories

The (GG) means that I modified the command to specifically support the B&R
system.  At and cron are standard System 5 utilities and are only necessary
if you use deferred backups.  Since deferred backups are so handy, it would
be silly not to have 'at' and 'cron' on the system...


22 Oct 86:
  Fred has modified the normal bru so that the '-g' option is now supported.
There are also hooks which allow local-only crossing of mounted file-systems.
Therefore, Fred's new 'bru' should be the one that is used with the B&R
system.  If it is not, then install the new version in '/backups/cmds/common'
so that B&R will use it.
  The changes that GG made to the Bourne shell have been merged into
the release source for the 'sh' program.  The B&R system checks that it is
running under the correct shell, and aborts if it finds it isn't.  Nothing
in B&R is sensitive to the name of the shell, only to its capabilities.
