be sure to add PREFERENCES item to main menu. Allows you to set various
things.
Notes -

Major sections:
- Background info about why backups are done, full vs.
incremental, system size and reliability tradeoffs, etc.  Be sure to define
terms.

¥ How to use this backup/restore package. Why things were done with simple
text menus and input, a basic overview (archive device description, files
saving times, all done with 'bru', etc.). Cover first-release tradeoffs, and
how to make the best of them

¥ Be sure that explanations are given in terms understandable to anyone.
Avoid "boot"; use "startup".

--- Add an item to the top menu called PREFERENCES.  It will allow changes
to all the little things like schedule time, confirmation options, and any
other things that can be saved away in files to make life easier for
someone.

Possible other items for preferences:
    - verbose size estimates?
    - verbose incremental backups?
    - verbose full backups?
    - save verbose info in log files?
    - never ask for confirmation
