# 22Oct86 GLG - The current contents of Names assumes that an appropriate
# version of 'bru' is already in place.  If this is not true, then install
# the bru into '/backups/cmds/common' manually.  You can test the needed
# features by making a SELECTED backup of a small directory, then using
# the EXAMINE & EXTRACT function under the RESTORE menu.  Older versions
# of 'bru' will not understand the needed option flags.
