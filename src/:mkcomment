# Someday, the .comments in objects will be more useful, but we'll
# at least # leave in the main .c entries, since they do reflect the
# versions of the .c's used to generate them, even if the versions do
# not start at 1 (or anywhere close ... since most are AT&T version 
# numbers).  Same is true for libraries, but we'll compress them,
# to remove duplicate .h entries...
